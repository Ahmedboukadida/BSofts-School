# Odoo Module Developer

## Overview

This skill transforms your AI into an expert Odoo custom module developer. It guides you through scaffolding new modules, defining models, setting up security, and following Odoo's coding conventions for both Community and Enterprise editions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting a new custom Odoo module from scratch.
- Extending an existing Odoo model (e.g., adding fields to `sale.order`).
- Troubleshooting module loading errors or manifest issues.
- Implementing `onchange`, `compute`, and `constraint` methods correctly.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-module-developer` and describe the module you want to build.
2. **Scaffold**: Get the full folder structure with `__manifest__.py`, `__init__.py`, models, views, and security files.
3. **Review**: Paste existing code and get a review against Odoo best practices.

## Examples

### Example 1: Scaffold a New Module

**Prompt:** `Create a module called "hospital_management" with a model for patients`

**Generated structure:**

```text
hospital_management/
├── __manifest__.py
├── __init__.py
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── hospital_patient.py
├── views/
│   └── hospital_patient_views.xml
├── security/
│   ├── ir.model.access.csv
│   └── security.xml
└── data/
```

**`__manifest__.py`:**

```python
{
    'name': 'Hospital Management',
    'version': '17.0.1.0.0',
    'category': 'Healthcare',
    'depends': ['base', 'mail'],
    'data': [
        'security/ir.model.access.csv',
        'views/hospital_patient_views.xml',
    ],
    'installable': True,
    'license': 'LGPL-3',
}
```

**`models/hospital_patient.py`:**

```python
from odoo import models, fields, api

class HospitalPatient(models.Model):
    _name = 'hospital.patient'
    _description = 'Hospital Patient'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']

    name = fields.Char(string='Patient Name', required=True, tracking=True)
    birth_date = fields.Date(string='Birth Date')
    doctor_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', string='Assigned Doctor')
    state = fields.Selection([
        ('draft', 'New'),
        ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'),
        ('done', 'Done'),
    ], default='draft', tracking=True)
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Always prefix your model `_name` with a namespace (e.g., `hospital.patient`).
- ✅ **Do:** Use `_inherit = ['mail.thread']` to add chatter/logging automatically.
- ✅ **Do:** Specify `version` in manifest as `{odoo_version}.{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.
- ✅ **Do:** Set `'author'` and `'website'` in `__manifest__.py` so your module is identifiable in the Apps list.
- ❌ **Don't:** Modify core Odoo model files directly — always use `_inherit`.
- ❌ **Don't:** Forget to add new models to `ir.model.access.csv` or users will get access errors.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use spaces or uppercase in folder names — Odoo requires snake_case module names.

## Limitations

- Does not cover **OWL JavaScript components** or frontend widget development — use `@odoo-xml-views-builder` for view XML.
- **Odoo 13 and below** have a different module structure (no `__manifest__.py` auto-loading) — this skill targets v14+.
- Does not cover **multi-company** or **multi-website** configuration; those require additional model fields (`company_id`, `website_id`).
- Does not generate automated test files — use `@odoo-automated-tests` for that.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
