# Odoo ORM Expert

## Overview

This skill teaches you Odoo's Object Relational Mapper (ORM) in depth. It covers reading/writing records, building domain filters, working with relational fields, and avoiding common performance pitfalls like N+1 queries.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing `search()`, `browse()`, `create()`, `write()`, or `unlink()` calls.
- Building complex domain filters for views or server actions.
- Implementing computed, stored, and related fields.
- Debugging slow queries or optimizing bulk operations.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-orm-expert` and describe what data operation you need.
2. **Get Code**: Receive correct, idiomatic Odoo ORM code with explanations.
3. **Optimize**: Ask for performance review on existing ORM code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Search with Domain Filters

```python
# Find all confirmed sale orders for a specific customer, created this year
import datetime

start_of_year = datetime.date.today().replace(month=1, day=1).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

orders = self.env['sale.order'].search([
    ('partner_id', '=', partner_id),
    ('state', '=', 'sale'),
    ('date_order', '>=', start_of_year),
], order='date_order desc', limit=50)

# Note: pass dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings in domains,
# NOT as fields.Date objects — the ORM serializes them correctly.
```

### Example 2: Computed Field

```python
total_order_count = fields.Integer(
    string='Total Orders',
    compute='_compute_total_order_count',
    store=True
)

@api.depends('sale_order_ids')
def _compute_total_order_count(self):
    for record in self:
        record.total_order_count = len(record.sale_order_ids)
```

### Example 3: Safe Bulk Write (avoid N+1)

```python
# ✅ GOOD: One query for all records
partners = self.env['res.partner'].search([('country_id', '=', False)])
partners.write({'country_id': self.env.ref('base.us').id})

# ❌ BAD: Triggers a separate query per record
for partner in partners:
    partner.country_id = self.env.ref('base.us').id
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Use `mapped()`, `filtered()`, and `sorted()` on recordsets instead of Python loops.
- ✅ **Do:** Use `sudo()` sparingly and only when you understand the security implications.
- ✅ **Do:** Prefer `search_count()` over `len(search(...))` when you only need a count.
- ✅ **Do:** Use `with_context(...)` to pass context values cleanly rather than modifying `self.env.context` directly.
- ❌ **Don't:** Call `search()` inside a loop — this is the #1 Odoo performance killer.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use raw SQL unless absolutely necessary; use ORM for all standard operations.
- ❌ **Don't:** Pass Python `datetime`/`date` objects directly into domain tuples — always stringify them as `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.

## Limitations

- Does not cover **`cr.execute()` raw SQL** patterns in depth — use the Odoo performance tuner skill for SQL-level optimization.
- **Stored computed fields** can cause significant write overhead at scale; this skill does not cover partitioning strategies.
- Does not cover **transient models** (`models.TransientModel`) or wizard patterns.
- ORM behavior can differ slightly between Odoo SaaS and On-Premise due to config overrides.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
