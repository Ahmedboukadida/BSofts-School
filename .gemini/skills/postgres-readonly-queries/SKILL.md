# PostgreSQL Read-Only Query Skill

## When to Use

- Use when querying PostgreSQL databases and access must stay strictly read-only
- Use when exploring schemas, tables, and data across multiple configured connections
- Use when you want defense-in-depth protection against accidental INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE or DDL

Execute safe, read-only queries against configured PostgreSQL databases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- psycopg2-binary: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup

Create `connections.json` in the skill directory or `~/.config/claude/postgres-connections.json`.

**Security**: Set file permissions to `600` since it contains credentials:
```bash
chmod 600 connections.json
```

```json
{
  "databases": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "description": "Main app database - users, orders, transactions",
      "host": "db.example.com",
      "port": 5432,
      "database": "app_prod",
      "user": "readonly_user",
      "password": "your-password",
      "sslmode": "require"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Config Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| name | Yes | Identifier for the database (case-insensitive) |
| description | Yes | What data this database contains (used for auto-selection) |
| host | Yes | Database hostname |
| port | No | Port number (default: 5432) |
| database | Yes | Database name |
| user | Yes | Username |
| password | Yes | Password |
| sslmode | No | SSL mode: disable, allow, prefer (default), require, verify-ca, verify-full |

## Usage

### List configured databases
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --list
```

### Query a database
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --db production --query "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10"
```

### List tables
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --db production --tables
```

### Show schema
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --db production --schema
```

### Limit results
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --db production --query "SELECT * FROM orders" --limit 100
```

## Database Selection

Match user intent to database `description`:

| User asks about | Look for description containing |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| users, accounts | users, accounts, customers |
| orders, sales | orders, transactions, sales |
| analytics, metrics | analytics, metrics, reports |
| logs, events | logs, events, audit |

If unclear, run `--list` and ask user which database.

## Safety Features

- **Read-only session**: Connection uses PostgreSQL `readonly=True` mode (primary protection)
- **Query validation**: Only SELECT, SHOW, EXPLAIN, WITH queries allowed
- **Single statement**: Multiple statements per query rejected
- **SSL support**: Configurable SSL mode for encrypted connections
- **Query timeout**: 30-second statement timeout enforced
- **Memory protection**: Max 10,000 rows per query to prevent OOM
- **Column width cap**: 100 char max per column for readable output
- **Credential sanitization**: Error messages don't leak passwords

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Config not found | Create `connections.json` in skill directory |
| Authentication failed | Check username/password in config |
| Connection timeout | Verify host/port, check firewall/VPN |
| SSL error | Try `"sslmode": "disable"` for local databases |
| Permission warning | Run `chmod 600 connections.json` |

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success
- **1**: Error (config missing, auth failed, invalid query, database error)

## Workflow

1. Run `--list` to show available databases
2. Match user intent to database description
3. Run `--tables` or `--schema` to explore structure
4. Execute query with appropriate LIMIT

## Limitations

- Read-only protections reduce accidental writes but cannot override database-server policy,
  triggers, extensions, or an over-privileged account. Use a database role with read-only
  permissions as the primary control.
- Query results can contain personal, confidential, or regulated data. Confirm the intended
  database and avoid exporting or sharing results without explicit authorization.
- The script is not a replacement for backups, auditing, access reviews, or production change
  controls.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
