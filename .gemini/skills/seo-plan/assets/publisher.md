### NewsArticle Schema Example
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "headline": "Article Headline",
  "datePublished": "2026-02-07T10:00:00Z",
  "dateModified": "2026-02-07T14:30:00Z",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name",
    "url": "https://example.com/authors/author-name"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Publication Name",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://example.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "image": ["https://example.com/article-image.jpg"],
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "https://example.com/article-url"

}
```

## E-E-A-T Requirements

Publishers face highest E-E-A-T scrutiny.

### Author Pages Must Include
- Full name and photo
- Bio and credentials
- Areas of expertise
- Contact information
- Social profiles (sameAs)
- Previous articles by this author

### Editorial Standards
- Clear correction policy
- Transparent editorial process
- Fact-checking procedures
- Conflict of interest disclosures

## Content Priorities

### High Priority
1. Breaking news (speed matters)
2. Evergreen guides on core topics
3. Author pages with credentials
4. Topic hubs/pillar pages

### Medium Priority
1. Opinion/analysis pieces
2. Video content
3. Interactive content
4. Newsletter landing pages

### GEO Considerations
- Clear, quotable facts in articles
- Tables for data-heavy content
- Expert quotes with attribution
- Update dates prominently displayed
- Structured headings (H2/H3)
- First-party data and original research are highly cited by AI systems
- Ensure author entities are clearly defined with Person schema + sameAs links
- Monitor AI citation frequency across Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, ChatGPT, Perplexity
- Treat AI citation as a standalone KPI alongside organic traffic

### Publisher SEO Updates (2025-2026)

- **Google News automatic inclusion:** Google News no longer accepts manual applications (since March 2025). Inclusion is fully automatic based on Google's content quality criteria. Focus on Google News sitemap markup and consistent, high-quality publishing cadence.
- **KPI shift:** Traffic-based KPIs (sessions, pageviews) are declining in relevance as AI Overviews reduce click-through rates. Leading publishers are shifting to: subscriber conversions, time on page, scroll depth, newsletter signups, AI citation frequency, and revenue per visitor.
- **Site reputation abuse risk:** Publishers hosting third-party content (coupons, product reviews, affiliate content) under their domain are at high risk. Google penalized Forbes, WSJ, Time, and CNN for this in late 2024. If hosting third-party content, ensure strong editorial oversight and clear first-party involvement.

## Technical Considerations

### Core Web Vitals
- Ad placement affects CLS
- Lazy load ads and images below fold
- Optimize hero images for LCP
- Minimize render-blocking resources

### AMP (if used)
- Consider dropping AMP (no longer required for Top Stories)
- Ensure canonical setup is correct
- Monitor performance vs non-AMP

### Pagination
- Proper pagination for multi-page articles
- Or infinite scroll with proper indexing
- Canonical to page 1 or full article

## Key Metrics to Track

- Page views from organic
- Time on page
- Pages per session
- Newsletter signups from organic
- Google News/Discover traffic
- AI Overview appearances

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
