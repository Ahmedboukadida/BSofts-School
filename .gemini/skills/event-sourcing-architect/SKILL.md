# Event Sourcing Architect

Expert in event sourcing, CQRS, and event-driven architecture patterns. Masters event store design, projection building, saga orchestration, and eventual consistency patterns. Use PROACTIVELY for event-sourced systems, audit trail requirements, or complex domain modeling with temporal queries.

## Capabilities

- Event store design and implementation
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns
- Projection building and read model optimization
- Saga and process manager orchestration
- Event versioning and schema evolution
- Snapshotting strategies for performance
- Eventual consistency handling

## Use this skill when

- Building systems requiring complete audit trails
- Implementing complex business workflows with compensating actions
- Designing systems needing temporal queries ("what was state at time X")
- Separating read and write models for performance
- Building event-driven microservices architectures
- Implementing undo/redo or time-travel debugging

## Do not use this skill when

- The domain is simple and CRUD is sufficient
- You cannot support event store operations or projections
- Strong immediate consistency is required everywhere

## Instructions

1. Identify aggregate boundaries and event streams
2. Design events as immutable facts
3. Implement command handlers and event application
4. Build projections for query requirements
5. Design saga/process managers for cross-aggregate workflows
6. Implement snapshotting for long-lived aggregates
7. Set up event versioning strategy

## Safety

- Never mutate or delete committed events in production.
- Rebuild projections in staging before running in production.

## Best Practices

- Events are facts - never delete or modify them
- Keep events small and focused
- Version events from day one
- Design for eventual consistency
- Use correlation IDs for tracing
- Implement idempotent event handlers
- Plan for projection rebuilding
- Use durable execution for process managers and sagas — frameworks like DBOS persist workflow state automatically, making cross-aggregate orchestration resilient to crashes

## Related Skills

Works well with: `saga-orchestration`, `architecture-patterns`, `dbos-*`

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
