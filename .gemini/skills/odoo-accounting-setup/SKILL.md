# Odoo Accounting Setup

## Overview

This skill guides functional consultants and business owners through setting up Odoo Accounting correctly from scratch. It covers chart of accounts configuration, journal setup, tax rules, fiscal positions, payment terms, and the bank statement reconciliation workflow.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up a new Odoo instance for a company for the first time.
- Configuring multi-currency or multi-company accounting.
- Troubleshooting tax calculation or fiscal position mapping errors.
- Creating payment terms for installment billing (e.g., Net 30, 50% upfront).

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-accounting-setup` and describe your accounting scenario.
2. **Configure**: Receive step-by-step Odoo menu navigation with exact field values.
3. **Validate**: Get a checklist to verify your setup is complete and correct.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Payment Term (Net 30 with 2% Early Pay Discount)

```text
Menu: Accounting → Configuration → Payment Terms → New

Name: Net 30 / 2% Early Pay Discount
Company: [Your Company]

Lines:
  Line 1:
    - Due Type: Percent
    - Value: 100%
    - Due: 30 days (full balance due in 30 days)

Early Payment Discount (Odoo 16+):
  Discount %: 2
  Discount Days: 10
  Balance Sheet Accounts:
    - Gain: 4900 Early Payment Discounts Granted
    - Loss: 5900 Early Payment Discounts Received
```

> **Note (v16+):** Use the built-in **Early Payment Discount** field instead of the old split-line workaround. Odoo now posts the discount automatically when the customer pays within the discount window and generates correct accounting entries.

### Example 2: Fiscal Position for EU VAT (B2B Intra-Community)

```text
Menu: Accounting → Configuration → Fiscal Positions → New

Name: EU Intra-Community B2B
Auto-detection: ON
  - Country Group: Europe
  - VAT Required: YES (customer must have EU VAT number)

Tax Mapping:
  Tax on Sales (21% VAT) → 0% Intra-Community VAT
  Tax on Purchases      → 0% Reverse Charge

Account Mapping:
  (Leave empty unless your localization requires account remapping)
```

### Example 3: Reconciliation Model for Bank Fees

```text
Menu: Accounting → Configuration → Reconciliation Models → New

Name: Bank Fee Auto-Match
Type: Write-off
Matching Order: 1

Conditions:
  - Label Contains: "BANK FEE" OR "SERVICE CHARGE"
  - Amount Type: Amount is lower than: $50.00

Action:
  - Account: 6200 Bank Charges
  - Tax: None
  - Analytic: Administrative
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Install your country's **localization module** first (`l10n_us`, `l10n_mx`, etc.) before manually creating accounts — it sets up the correct chart of accounts.
- ✅ **Do:** Use **Fiscal Positions** to automate B2B vs B2C tax switching — never change taxes manually on individual invoices.
- ✅ **Do:** Lock accounting periods (Accounting → Actions → Lock Dates) after month-end closing to prevent retroactive edits.
- ✅ **Do:** Use the **Early Payment Discount** feature (v16+) instead of splitting payment term lines for discount modelling.
- ❌ **Don't:** Delete journal entries — always reverse them with a credit note or the built-in reversal function.
- ❌ **Don't:** Mix personal and business transactions in the same journal.
- ❌ **Don't:** Create manual journal entries to fix bank reconciliation mismatches — use the reconciliation model workflow instead.

## Limitations

- Does not cover **multi-currency revaluation** or foreign exchange gain/loss accounting in depth.
- **Country-specific e-invoicing** (CFDI, FatturaPA, SAF-T) requires additional localization modules — use `@odoo-l10n-compliance` for those.
- Payroll accounting integration (salary journals, deduction accounts) is not covered here — use `@odoo-hr-payroll-setup`.
- Odoo Community Edition does not include the full **lock dates** feature; some controls are Enterprise-only.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
