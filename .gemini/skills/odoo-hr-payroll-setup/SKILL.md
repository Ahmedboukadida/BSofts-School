# Odoo HR & Payroll Setup

## Overview

This skill guides HR managers and payroll accountants through setting up Odoo HR and Payroll correctly. It covers salary structure creation with Python-computed rules, time-off policies, employee contract types, and the payroll → accounting journal posting flow.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a salary structure with gross pay, deductions, and net pay.
- Configuring annual leave, sick leave, and public holiday policies.
- Troubleshooting incorrect payslip amounts or missing rule contributions.
- Setting up the payroll journal to correctly post to accounting.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-hr-payroll-setup` and describe your payroll scenario.
2. **Configure**: Receive step-by-step setup for salary rules and leave allocation.
3. **Debug**: Paste a salary rule or payslip issue and receive a root cause analysis.

## Examples

### Example 1: Salary Structure with Deductions

```text
Menu: Payroll → Configuration → Salary Structures → New

Name: US Employee Monthly
Payslip Code: MONTHLY

Rules (executed top-to-bottom — order matters):
  Code  | Name                   | Formula                        | Category
  ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------
  BASIC | Basic Wage             | contract.wage                  | Basic
  GROSS | Gross                  | BASIC                          | Gross
  SS    | Social Security (6.2%) | -GROSS * 0.062                 | Deduction
  MED   | Medicare (1.45%)       | -GROSS * 0.0145                | Deduction
  FIT   | Federal Income Tax     | -GROSS * inputs.FIT_RATE.amount| Deduction
  NET   | Net Salary             | GROSS + SS + MED + FIT         | Net
```

> **Federal Income Tax:** The standard Odoo US localization does not expose a single `l10n_us_w4_rate` field. Use an **input** (salary input type) to pass the withholding rate per employee, or install a community US payroll module (OCA `l10n_us_hr_payroll`) which handles W4 filing status properly.

### Example 2: Configure a Time Off Type

```text
Menu: Time Off → Configuration → Time Off Types → New

Name: Annual Leave / PTO
Approval: Time Off Officer
Leave Validation: Time Off Officer  (single approver)
  or: "Both" for HR + Manager double approval

Allocation:
  ☑ Employees can allocate time off themselves
  Requires approval: No

Negative Balance: Not allowed (employees cannot go negative)

Then create initial allocations:
Menu: Time Off → Managers → Allocations → New
  Employee: [Each employee]
  Time Off Type: Annual Leave / PTO
  Allocation: 15 days
  Validity: Jan 1 – Dec 31 [current year]
```

### Example 3: Payroll Journal Entry Result

```text
After validating a payroll batch, Odoo generates:

Debit   Salary Expense Account     $5,000.00
  Credit  Social Security Payable     $310.00
  Credit  Medicare Payable             $72.50
  Credit  Federal Tax Payable         (varies)
  Credit  Salary Payable           $4,617.50+

When net salary is paid:
Debit   Salary Payable            $4,617.50
  Credit  Bank Account              $4,617.50

Employer taxes (e.g., FUTA, SUTA) post as separate journal entries.
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Install your country's **payroll localization** (`l10n_us_hr_payroll`, `l10n_mx_hr_payroll`, etc.) before building custom rules — it provides pre-configured tax structures.
- ✅ **Do:** Use **salary rule inputs** (`inputs.ALLOWANCE.amount`) to pass variable values (bonuses, allowances, withholding rates) rather than hardcoding them in the rule formula.
- ✅ **Do:** Archive old salary structures rather than deleting them — active payslips reference their structure and will break if the structure is deleted.
- ✅ **Do:** Always set an active **Employee Contract** with correct dates and salary before generating payslips.
- ❌ **Don't:** Manually edit posted payslips — cancel and regenerate the payslip batch if corrections are needed.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use `contract.wage` in deduction rules without verifying whether the structure is monthly or annual — always check the contract wage period.

## Limitations

- **Odoo Payroll is Enterprise-only** — the Community Edition does not include the Payroll module (`hr_payroll`).
- US-specific compliance (W2, 941, state SUI/SDI filing) requires additional modules beyond the base localization; Odoo does not generate tax filings directly.
- Does not cover **multi-country payroll** (employees in different countries require separate structures and localizations).
- **Expense reimbursements** via payslip (e.g., mileage, home office) require a custom salary rule input and are not covered in standard HR Payroll documentation.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
