# GitLab CI Patterns

Comprehensive GitLab CI/CD pipeline patterns for automated testing, building, and deployment.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to gitlab ci patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Purpose

Create efficient GitLab CI pipelines with proper stage organization, caching, and deployment strategies.

## Use this skill when

- Automate GitLab-based CI/CD
- Implement multi-stage pipelines
- Configure GitLab Runners
- Deploy to Kubernetes from GitLab
- Implement GitOps workflows

## Basic Pipeline Structure

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 hour
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - node_modules/

test:
  stage: test
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run lint
    - npm test
  coverage: '/Lines\s*:\s*(\d+\.\d+)%/'
  artifacts:
    reports:
      coverage_report:
        coverage_format: cobertura
        path: coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: bitnami/kubectl:latest
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/
    - kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app
  only:
    - main
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://app.example.com
```

## Docker Build and Push

```yaml
build-docker:
  stage: build
  image: docker:24
  services:
    - docker:24-dind
  before_script:
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
  only:
    - main
    - tags
```

## Multi-Environment Deployment

```yaml
.deploy_template: &deploy_template
  image: bitnami/kubectl:latest
  before_script:
    - kubectl config set-cluster k8s --server="$KUBE_URL" --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
    - kubectl config set-credentials admin --token="$KUBE_TOKEN"
    - kubectl config set-context default --cluster=k8s --user=admin
    - kubectl config use-context default

deploy:staging:
  <<: *deploy_template
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/ -n staging
    - kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app -n staging
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
  only:
    - develop

deploy:production:
  <<: *deploy_template
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/ -n production
    - kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app -n production
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://app.example.com
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

## Terraform Pipeline

```yaml
stages:
  - validate
  - plan
  - apply

variables:
  TF_ROOT: ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/terraform
  TF_VERSION: "1.6.0"

before_script:
  - cd ${TF_ROOT}
  - terraform --version

validate:
  stage: validate
  image: hashicorp/terraform:${TF_VERSION}
  script:
    - terraform init -backend=false
    - terraform validate
    - terraform fmt -check

plan:
  stage: plan
  image: hashicorp/terraform:${TF_VERSION}
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform plan -out=tfplan
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - ${TF_ROOT}/tfplan
    expire_in: 1 day

apply:
  stage: apply
  image: hashicorp/terraform:${TF_VERSION}
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
  dependencies:
    - plan
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

## Security Scanning

```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

trivy-scan:
  stage: test
  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
  script:
    - trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  allow_failure: true
```

## Caching Strategies

```yaml
# Cache node_modules
build:
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - node_modules/
    policy: pull-push

# Global cache
cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - .cache/
    - vendor/

# Separate cache per job
job1:
  cache:
    key: job1-cache
    paths:
      - build/

job2:
  cache:
    key: job2-cache
    paths:
      - dist/
```

## Dynamic Child Pipelines

```yaml
generate-pipeline:
  stage: build
  script:
    - python generate_pipeline.py > child-pipeline.yml
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - child-pipeline.yml

trigger-child:
  stage: deploy
  trigger:
    include:
      - artifact: child-pipeline.yml
        job: generate-pipeline
    strategy: depend
```

- `assets/gitlab-ci.yml.template` - Complete pipeline template
- `references/pipeline-stages.md` - Stage organization patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific image tags** (node:20, not node:latest)
2. **Cache dependencies** appropriately
3. **Use artifacts** for build outputs
4. **Implement manual gates** for production
5. **Use environments** for deployment tracking
6. **Enable merge request pipelines**
7. **Use pipeline schedules** for recurring jobs
8. **Implement security scanning**
9. **Use CI/CD variables** for secrets
10. **Monitor pipeline performance**

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
