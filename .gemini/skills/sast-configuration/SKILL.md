# SAST Configuration

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool setup, configuration, and custom rule creation for comprehensive security scanning across multiple programming languages.

## Use this skill when

- Set up SAST scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Create custom security rules for your codebase
- Configure quality gates and compliance policies
- Optimize scan performance and reduce false positives
- Integrate multiple SAST tools for defense-in-depth

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need DAST or manual penetration testing guidance
- You cannot access source code or CI/CD pipelines
- You need organizational policy decisions rather than tooling setup

## Instructions

1. Identify languages, repos, and compliance requirements.
2. Choose tools and define a baseline policy.
3. Integrate scans into CI/CD with gating thresholds.
4. Tune rules and suppressions based on false positives.
5. Track remediation and verify fixes.

## Safety

- Avoid scanning sensitive repos with third-party services without approval.
- Prevent leaks of secrets in scan artifacts and logs.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for setting up and configuring SAST tools including Semgrep, SonarQube, and CodeQL.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Semgrep Configuration
- Custom rule creation with pattern matching
- Language-specific security rules (Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, etc.)
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- False positive tuning and rule optimization
- Organizational policy enforcement

### 2. SonarQube Setup
- Quality gate configuration
- Security hotspot analysis
- Code coverage and technical debt tracking
- Custom quality profiles for languages
- Enterprise integration with LDAP/SAML

### 3. CodeQL Analysis
- GitHub Advanced Security integration
- Custom query development
- Vulnerability variant analysis
- Security research workflows
- SARIF result processing

## Quick Start

### Initial Assessment
1. Identify primary programming languages in your codebase
2. Determine compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.)
3. Choose SAST tool based on language support and integration needs
4. Review baseline scan to understand current security posture

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Semgrep quick start
pip install semgrep
semgrep --config=auto --error

# SonarQube with Docker
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest

# CodeQL CLI setup
gh extension install github/gh-codeql
codeql database create mydb --language=python
```

## Reference Documentation

- SonarQube Configuration - Quality gates and profiles
- CodeQL Setup Guide - Query development and workflows

## Templates & Assets

- semgrep-config.yml - Production-ready Semgrep configuration
- sonarqube-settings.xml - SonarQube quality profile template
- run-sast.sh - Automated SAST execution script

## Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Semgrep
  uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
  with:
    config: >-
      p/security-audit
      p/owasp-top-ten
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
  rev: v1.45.0
  hooks:
    - id: semgrep
      args: ['--config=auto', '--error']
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Baseline**
   - Run initial scan to establish security baseline
   - Prioritize critical and high severity findings
   - Create remediation roadmap

2. **Incremental Adoption**
   - Begin with security-focused rules
   - Gradually add code quality rules
   - Implement blocking only for critical issues

3. **False Positive Management**
   - Document legitimate suppressions
   - Create allow lists for known safe patterns
   - Regularly review suppressed findings

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Exclude test files and generated code
   - Use incremental scanning for large codebases
   - Cache scan results in CI/CD

5. **Team Enablement**
   - Provide security training for developers
   - Create internal documentation for common patterns
   - Establish security champions program

## Common Use Cases

### New Project Setup
```bash
./scripts/run-sast.sh --setup --language python --tools semgrep,sonarqube
```

### Custom Rule Development
```yaml
# See references/semgrep-rules.md for detailed examples
rules:
  - id: hardcoded-jwt-secret
    pattern: jwt.encode($DATA, "...", ...)
    message: JWT secret should not be hardcoded
    severity: ERROR
```

### Compliance Scanning
```bash
# PCI-DSS focused scan
semgrep --config p/pci-dss --json -o pci-scan-results.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### High False Positive Rate
- Review and tune rule sensitivity
- Add path filters to exclude test files
- Use nostmt metadata for noisy patterns
- Create organization-specific rule exceptions

### Performance Issues
- Enable incremental scanning
- Parallelize scans across modules
- Optimize rule patterns for efficiency
- Cache dependencies and scan results

### Integration Failures
- Verify API tokens and credentials
- Check network connectivity and proxy settings
- Review SARIF output format compatibility
- Validate CI/CD runner permissions

| SonarQube | Code quality + security | 25+ languages | Free/Commercial | Good |
| CodeQL | Deep analysis, research | 10+ languages | Free (OSS) | GitHub native |

## Next Steps

1. Complete initial SAST tool setup
2. Run baseline security scan
3. Create custom rules for organization-specific patterns
4. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
5. Establish security gate policies
6. Train development team on findings and remediation

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
