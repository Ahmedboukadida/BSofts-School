# Postgres Best Practices - Contributor Guide

This repository contains Postgres performance optimization rules optimized for
AI agents and LLMs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd packages/postgres-best-practices-build
npm install

# Validate existing rules
npm run validate

# Build AGENTS.md
npm run build
```

## Creating a New Rule

1. **Choose a section prefix** based on the category:
   - `query-` Query Performance (CRITICAL)
   - `conn-` Connection Management (CRITICAL)
   - `security-` Security & RLS (CRITICAL)
   - `schema-` Schema Design (HIGH)
   - `lock-` Concurrency & Locking (MEDIUM-HIGH)
   - `data-` Data Access Patterns (MEDIUM)
   - `monitor-` Monitoring & Diagnostics (LOW-MEDIUM)
   - `advanced-` Advanced Features (LOW)

2. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp rules/_template.md rules/query-your-rule-name.md
   ```

3. **Fill in the content** following the template structure

4. **Validate and build**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Review** the generated `AGENTS.md`

## Rule File Structure

See `rules/_template.md` for the complete template. Key elements:

````markdown
---
title: Clear, Action-Oriented Title
impact: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM-HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW-MEDIUM|LOW
impactDescription: Quantified benefit (e.g., "10-100x faster")
tags: relevant, keywords
---

## [Title]

[1-2 sentence explanation]

**Incorrect (description):**

```sql
-- Comment explaining what's wrong
[Bad SQL example]
```
````

**Correct (description):**

```sql
-- Comment explaining why this is better
[Good SQL example]
```

```
## Writing Guidelines

See `rules/_contributing.md` for detailed guidelines. Key principles:

1. **Show concrete transformations** - "Change X to Y", not abstract advice
2. **Error-first structure** - Show the problem before the solution
3. **Quantify impact** - Include specific metrics (10x faster, 50% smaller)
4. **Self-contained examples** - Complete, runnable SQL
5. **Semantic naming** - Use meaningful names (users, email), not (table1, col1)

## Impact Levels

| Level | Improvement | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| CRITICAL | 10-100x | Missing indexes, connection exhaustion |
| HIGH | 5-20x | Wrong index types, poor partitioning |
| MEDIUM-HIGH | 2-5x | N+1 queries, RLS optimization |
| MEDIUM | 1.5-3x | Redundant indexes, stale statistics |
| LOW-MEDIUM | 1.2-2x | VACUUM tuning, config tweaks |
| LOW | Incremental | Advanced patterns, edge cases |

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
