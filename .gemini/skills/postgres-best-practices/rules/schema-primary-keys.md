## Select Optimal Primary Key Strategy

Primary key choice affects insert performance, index size, and replication
efficiency.

**Incorrect (problematic PK choices):**

```sql
-- identity is the SQL-standard approach
create table users (
  id serial primary key  -- Works, but IDENTITY is recommended
);

-- Random UUIDs (v4) cause index fragmentation
create table orders (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key  -- UUIDv4 = random = scattered inserts
);
```

**Correct (optimal PK strategies):**

```sql
-- Use IDENTITY for sequential IDs (SQL-standard, best for most cases)
create table users (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key
);

-- For distributed systems needing UUIDs, use UUIDv7 (time-ordered)
-- Requires pg_uuidv7 extension: create extension pg_uuidv7;
create table orders (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v7() primary key  -- Time-ordered, no fragmentation
);

-- Alternative: time-prefixed IDs for sortable, distributed IDs (no extension needed)
create table events (
  id text default concat(
    to_char(now() at time zone 'utc', 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISSMS'),
    gen_random_uuid()::text
  ) primary key
);
```

Guidelines:

- Single database: `bigint identity` (sequential, 8 bytes, SQL-standard)
- Distributed/exposed IDs: UUIDv7 (requires pg_uuidv7) or ULID (time-ordered, no
  fragmentation)
- `serial` works but `identity` is SQL-standard and preferred for new
  applications
- Avoid random UUIDs (v4) as primary keys on large tables (causes index
  fragmentation)

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
