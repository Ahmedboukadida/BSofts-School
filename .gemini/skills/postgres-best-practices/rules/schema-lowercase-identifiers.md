## Use Lowercase Identifiers for Compatibility

PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers to lowercase. Quoted mixed-case identifiers require quotes forever and cause issues with tools, ORMs, and AI assistants that may not recognize them.

**Incorrect (mixed-case identifiers):**

```sql
-- Quoted identifiers preserve case but require quotes everywhere
CREATE TABLE "Users" (
  "userId" bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  "firstName" text,
  "lastName" text
);

-- Must always quote or queries fail
SELECT "firstName" FROM "Users" WHERE "userId" = 1;

-- This fails - Users becomes users without quotes
SELECT firstName FROM Users;
-- ERROR: relation "users" does not exist
```

**Correct (lowercase snake_case):**

```sql
-- Unquoted lowercase identifiers are portable and tool-friendly
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name text,
  last_name text
);

-- Works without quotes, recognized by all tools
SELECT first_name FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;
```

Common sources of mixed-case identifiers:

```sql
-- ORMs often generate quoted camelCase - configure them to use snake_case
-- Migrations from other databases may preserve original casing
-- Some GUI tools quote identifiers by default - disable this

-- If stuck with mixed-case, create views as a compatibility layer
CREATE VIEW users AS SELECT "userId" AS user_id, "firstName" AS first_name FROM "Users";
```

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
