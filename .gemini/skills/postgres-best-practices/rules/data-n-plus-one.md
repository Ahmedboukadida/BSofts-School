## Eliminate N+1 Queries with Batch Loading

N+1 queries execute one query per item in a loop. Batch them into a single query using arrays or JOINs.

**Incorrect (N+1 queries):**

```sql
-- First query: get all users
select id from users where active = true;  -- Returns 100 IDs

-- Then N queries, one per user
select * from orders where user_id = 1;
select * from orders where user_id = 2;
select * from orders where user_id = 3;
-- ... 97 more queries!

-- Total: 101 round trips to database
```

**Correct (single batch query):**

```sql
-- Collect IDs and query once with ANY
select * from orders where user_id = any(array[1, 2, 3, ...]);

-- Or use JOIN instead of loop
select u.id, u.name, o.*
from users u
left join orders o on o.user_id = u.id
where u.active = true;

-- Total: 1 round trip
```

Application pattern:

```sql
-- Instead of looping in application code:
-- for user in users: db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1", user.id)

-- Pass array parameter:
select * from orders where user_id = any($1::bigint[]);
-- Application passes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
```

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
