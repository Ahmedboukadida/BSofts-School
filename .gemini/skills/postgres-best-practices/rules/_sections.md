# Section Definitions

This file defines the rule categories for Postgres best practices. Rules are automatically assigned to sections based on their filename prefix.

Take the examples below as pure demonstrative. Replace each section with the actual rule categories for Postgres best practices.

---

## 1. Query Performance (query)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Slow queries, missing indexes, inefficient query plans. The most common source of Postgres performance issues.

## 2. Connection Management (conn)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Connection pooling, limits, and serverless strategies. Critical for applications with high concurrency or serverless deployments.

## 3. Security & RLS (security)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Row-Level Security policies, privilege management, and authentication patterns.

## 4. Schema Design (schema)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Table design, index strategies, partitioning, and data type selection. Foundation for long-term performance.

## 5. Concurrency & Locking (lock)
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Description:** Transaction management, isolation levels, deadlock prevention, and lock contention patterns.

## 6. Data Access Patterns (data)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** N+1 query elimination, batch operations, cursor-based pagination, and efficient data fetching.

## 7. Monitoring & Diagnostics (monitor)
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Description:** Using pg_stat_statements, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, metrics collection, and performance diagnostics.

## 8. Advanced Features (advanced)
**Impact:** LOW
**Description:** Full-text search, JSONB optimization, PostGIS, extensions, and advanced Postgres features.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
