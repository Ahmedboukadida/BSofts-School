# Senior Architect

Complete toolkit for senior architect with modern tools and best practices.

## Quick Start

### Main Capabilities

This skill provides three core capabilities through automated scripts:

```bash
# Script 1: Architecture Diagram Generator
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py [options]

python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py [options]
```

## Core Capabilities

```bash
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py <project-path> [options]
```

### 2. Project Architect

Comprehensive analysis and optimization tool.

**Features:**
- Deep analysis
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations
- Automated fixes

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/project_architect.py <target-path> [--verbose]
```

### 3. Dependency Analyzer

Advanced tooling for specialized tasks.

**Features:**
- Expert-level automation

- Integration ready
- Production-grade output

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py [arguments] [options]
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup and Configuration

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Use the analyzer script
python scripts/project_architect.py .

# Review recommendations
# Apply fixes
```

### 3. Implement Best Practices

Follow the patterns and practices documented in:
- `references/architecture_patterns.md`
- `references/system_design_workflows.md`
- `references/tech_decision_guide.md`

## Best Practices Summary

### Code Quality
- Follow established patterns
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document decisions
- Review regularly

### Performance
- Measure before optimizing
- Use appropriate caching
- Optimize critical paths
- Monitor in production

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication
- Keep dependencies updated

### Maintainability
- Write clear code
- Use consistent naming
- Add helpful comments
- Keep it simple

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint

# Analysis
python scripts/project_architect.py .
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py --analyze

# Deployment
docker build -t app:latest .
docker-compose up -d
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

Check the comprehensive troubleshooting section in `references/tech_decision_guide.md`.

### Getting Help

- Review reference documentation
- Check script output messages

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
