# Web Security Testing Workflow

## Overview

Specialized workflow for testing web applications against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including injection attacks, XSS, broken authentication, and access control issues.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this workflow when:
- Testing web application security
- Performing OWASP Top 10 assessment
- Conducting penetration tests
- Validating security controls
- Bug bounty hunting

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

#### Skills to Invoke
- `scanning-tools` - Security scanning
- `top-web-vulnerabilities` - OWASP knowledge

#### Actions
1. Map application surface
2. Identify technologies
3. Discover endpoints
4. Find subdomains
5. Document findings

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @scanning-tools to perform web application reconnaissance
```

### Phase 2: Injection Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `sql-injection-testing` - SQL injection
- `sqlmap-database-pentesting` - SQLMap

#### Actions
1. Test SQL injection
2. Test NoSQL injection
3. Test command injection
4. Test LDAP injection
5. Document vulnerabilities

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @sql-injection-testing to test for SQL injection
```

```
Use @sqlmap-database-pentesting to automate SQL injection testing
```

### Phase 3: XSS Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `xss-html-injection` - XSS testing
- `html-injection-testing` - HTML injection

#### Actions
1. Test reflected XSS
2. Test stored XSS
3. Test DOM-based XSS
4. Test XSS filters
5. Document findings

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @xss-html-injection to test for cross-site scripting
```

### Phase 4: Authentication Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `broken-authentication` - Authentication testing

#### Actions
1. Test credential stuffing
2. Test brute force protection
3. Test session management
4. Test password policies
5. Test MFA implementation

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @broken-authentication to test authentication security
```

### Phase 5: Access Control Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `idor-testing` - IDOR testing
- `file-path-traversal` - Path traversal

#### Actions
1. Test vertical privilege escalation
2. Test horizontal privilege escalation
3. Test IDOR vulnerabilities
4. Test directory traversal
5. Test unauthorized access

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @idor-testing to test for insecure direct object references
```

```
Use @file-path-traversal to test for path traversal
```

### Phase 6: Security Headers

#### Skills to Invoke
- `api-security-best-practices` - Security headers

#### Actions
1. Check CSP implementation
2. Verify HSTS configuration
3. Test X-Frame-Options
4. Check X-Content-Type-Options
5. Verify referrer policy

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @api-security-best-practices to audit security headers
```

### Phase 7: Reporting

#### Skills to Invoke
- `reporting-standards` - Security reporting

#### Actions
1. Document vulnerabilities
2. Assess risk levels
3. Provide remediation
4. Create proof of concept
5. Generate report

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @reporting-standards to create security report
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
