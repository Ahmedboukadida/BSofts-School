## Use Functional setState Updates

When updating state based on the current state value, use the functional update form of setState instead of directly referencing the state variable. This prevents stale closures, eliminates unnecessary dependencies, and creates stable callback references.

**Incorrect (requires state as dependency):**

```tsx
function TodoList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems)
  
  // Callback must depend on items, recreated on every items change
  const addItems = useCallback((newItems: Item[]) => {
    setItems([...items, ...newItems])
  }, [items])  // ❌ items dependency causes recreations
  
  // Risk of stale closure if dependency is forgotten
  const removeItem = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setItems(items.filter(item => item.id !== id))
  }, [])  // ❌ Missing items dependency - will use stale items!
  
  return <ItemsEditor items={items} onAdd={addItems} onRemove={removeItem} />
}
```

The first callback is recreated every time `items` changes, which can cause child components to re-render unnecessarily. The second callback has a stale closure bug—it will always reference the initial `items` value.

**Correct (stable callbacks, no stale closures):**

```tsx
function TodoList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems)
  
  // Stable callback, never recreated
  const addItems = useCallback((newItems: Item[]) => {
    setItems(curr => [...curr, ...newItems])
  }, [])  // ✅ No dependencies needed
  
  // Always uses latest state, no stale closure risk
  const removeItem = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setItems(curr => curr.filter(item => item.id !== id))
  }, [])  // ✅ Safe and stable
  
  return <ItemsEditor items={items} onAdd={addItems} onRemove={removeItem} />
}
```

**Benefits:**

1. **Stable callback references** - Callbacks don't need to be recreated when state changes
2. **No stale closures** - Always operates on the latest state value
3. **Fewer dependencies** - Simplifies dependency arrays and reduces memory leaks
4. **Prevents bugs** - Eliminates the most common source of React closure bugs

**When to use functional updates:**

- Any setState that depends on the current state value
- Inside useCallback/useMemo when state is needed
- Event handlers that reference state
- Async operations that update state

**When direct updates are fine:**

- Setting state to a static value: `setCount(0)`
- Setting state from props/arguments only: `setName(newName)`
- State doesn't depend on previous value

**Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, the compiler can automatically optimize some cases, but functional updates are still recommended for correctness and to prevent stale closure bugs.

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
