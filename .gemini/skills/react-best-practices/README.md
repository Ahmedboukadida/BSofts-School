# React Best Practices

A structured repository for creating and maintaining React Best Practices optimized for agents and LLMs.

## Structure

- `rules/` - Individual rule files (one per rule)
  - `_sections.md` - Section metadata (titles, impacts, descriptions)
  - `_template.md` - Template for creating new rules
  - `area-description.md` - Individual rule files
- `src/` - Build scripts and utilities
- `metadata.json` - Document metadata (version, organization, abstract)
- __`AGENTS.md`__ - Compiled output (generated)
- __`test-cases.json`__ - Test cases for LLM evaluation (generated)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build AGENTS.md from rules:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Validate rule files:
   ```bash
   pnpm validate
   ```

4. Extract test cases:
   ```bash
   pnpm extract-tests
   ```

## Creating a New Rule

1. Copy `rules/_template.md` to `rules/area-description.md`
2. Choose the appropriate area prefix:
   - `async-` for Eliminating Waterfalls (Section 1)
   - `bundle-` for Bundle Size Optimization (Section 2)
   - `server-` for Server-Side Performance (Section 3)
   - `client-` for Client-Side Data Fetching (Section 4)
   - `rerender-` for Re-render Optimization (Section 5)
   - `rendering-` for Rendering Performance (Section 6)
   - `js-` for JavaScript Performance (Section 7)
   - `advanced-` for Advanced Patterns (Section 8)
3. Fill in the frontmatter and content
4. Ensure you have clear examples with explanations
5. Run `pnpm build` to regenerate AGENTS.md and test-cases.json

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
title: Rule Title Here
impact: MEDIUM
impactDescription: Optional description
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
---

## Rule Title Here

Brief explanation of the rule and why it matters.

**Incorrect (description of what's wrong):**

```typescript
// Bad code example
```

**Correct (description of what's right):**

```typescript
// Good code example
```

Optional explanatory text after examples.

## File Naming Convention

- Files starting with `_` are special (excluded from build)
- Rule files: `area-description.md` (e.g., `async-parallel.md`)
- Section is automatically inferred from filename prefix
- Rules are sorted alphabetically by title within each section
- IDs (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) are auto-generated during build

## Impact Levels

- `CRITICAL` - Highest priority, major performance gains
- `HIGH` - Significant performance improvements
- `MEDIUM-HIGH` - Moderate-high gains
- `MEDIUM` - Moderate performance improvements
- `LOW-MEDIUM` - Low-medium gains
- `LOW` - Incremental improvements

## Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Compile rules into AGENTS.md
- `pnpm validate` - Validate all rule files
- `pnpm extract-tests` - Extract test cases for LLM evaluation
- `pnpm dev` - Build and validate

## Contributing

When adding or modifying rules:

1. Use the correct filename prefix for your section
2. Follow the `_template.md` structure
3. Include clear bad/good examples with explanations
4. Add appropriate tags
5. Run `pnpm build` to regenerate AGENTS.md and test-cases.json
6. Rules are automatically sorted by title - no need to manage numbers!

## 🛠️ Mandatory Workspace & Governance Directives (Upgraded Standards)

1. **Project Root & Paths**: Primary project workspace is E:\ToDo\BSofts.
2. **Auxiliary Workspace Directory Layout (.agents/bonus/)**:
   - **Scratch**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch — Scripting directory for creating temporary JS/TS scripts to inspect, verify, extract, or audit database & API components.
   - **Output**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Scratch\Output — Deliverable directory for exported reports, data dumps, and persistent deliverables.
   - **Vault**: E:\ToDo\BSofts\.agents\bonus\Vault — Persistent memory vault directory holding state files (README.md, STATUS.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, DECLARATIONS.md, PROJECT.md).
3. **Autonomous Execution Loop (Rule #12)**:
   [1. Receive Goal] ➔ [2. Work & Implement] ➔ [3. Check & Verify (tsc --noEmit)] ➔ [4. Re-work if not complete] ➔ [5. Deliver Result] ➔ [6. Update Vault Memos].
4. **Autonomous Execution Permissions (Rule #13)**: Full permission to read, write, create, move files, and execute scripts/commands under E:\ToDo\BSofts without asking for permission.
5. **Mandatory Deletion Confirmation Guard (Rule #14)**: MUST ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation before deleting any file, folder, or database table.
6. **Zero Database Data Loss Guard (Rule #15)**: NEVER run commands that accept database data loss (such as prisma db push --accept-data-loss or forced table drops).

## 👥 BSOFT 5-Actor Role Architecture & Permanent Deletion Governance

1. **Developer (System Developer / Me)**:
   - Full platform god-mode access across all companies, tenants, endpoints, and system settings.
   - **Exclusive Permanent Deletion Authority**: Hard permanent deletes can ONLY be executed by Developer users. Non-developer delete requests default to soft-delete or throw ForbiddenException.
2. **Super Admin (Subscription Buyer & Owner)**:
   - Buyer of the SaaS subscription for his company/companies.
   - Full administrative control and feature configuration for his own company/companies only.
3. **Admin (Company Administrator)**:
   - Highest operational authority in a specific company right after Super Admin.
   - Manages day-to-day operations, employees, inventory, sales, and finance within his assigned company.
4. **Employees (Company Staff)**:
   - Operational staff members (Sales Agent, Accountant, Warehouse Manager) with role-restricted permissions.
5. **Third Parties (Clients & Providers / Suppliers)**:
   - External Customers (CLIENT) and Suppliers (FOURNISSEUR) operating in **Spectator Mode** — consult-only access restricted strictly to their own related records.

7. **Permanent Recursive File System Access Guarantee (Rule #16)**: Permanent, unrestricted, recursive read, write, create, and move permissions across all files, directories, subdirectories, and nested paths under E:\ToDo\BSofts at all times without asking for confirmation.
